- Create a clear module/interface for converting between world, chunk, cube, and camera coordinates
    - it should be easy to convert between all in a way that makes bugs less likely



Things to add:

- persistence with compression
- Music & sound (blocks breaking/adding)
- cloud / sky instead of background blue clear sky color
